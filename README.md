Stanford Fortran Tutorials
==========================

This project contains the famous Stanford tutorials on Fortran 77 and
Fortran 99 converted to LaTeX source code and then compiled to PDFs.
Here are the URLs of the original tutorials that were published as HTML
pages:

  - https://web.stanford.edu/class/me200c/tutorial_77/
  - https://web.stanford.edu/class/me200c/tutorial_90/

The LaTeX source code has been written in such a manner that the
content of the compiled PDFs is as close to the original content as
possible. However, in the interest of better typography, a few changes
have been introduced. Here is a list of these changes:

  - Syntax highlighting has been added to code examples.
  - All headings have been update to use title case consistently, i.e.,
	all words, except minor words, in headings are capitalized. The
	original tutorial uses title case for some headings and not for
	others.
