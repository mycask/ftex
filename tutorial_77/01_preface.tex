\section{Preface}

The goal of this Fortran tutorial is to give a quick introduction to the
most common features of the Fortran 77 programming language. A companion
tutorial introduces the key enhancements found in Fortran 90. It is
\textit{not} a complete reference! Many details have been omitted. The
presentation focuses on scientific computations, mainly linear algebra.
The outline of this tutorial was inspired by the book \textit{``Handbook
for Matrix Computations''} by T.F. Coleman and C. Van Loan, published by
\href{http://www.siam.org/}{SIAM}. Sections of this tutorial pertaining
to Fortran 90 were based on the book \textit{``FORTRAN 77 for Engineers
and Scientists with an Introduction to Fortran 90''} by L. Nyhoff and S.
Leestma published by Prentice Hall.

This tutorial was designed by Erik Boman to be used in the course
\textit{SCCM-001-F: Introduction to Fortran} taught at Stanford
University, Winter quarter 1996. It has been modified by Sarah T.
Whitlock and Paul H. Hargrove for use in the Fortran courses which have
been offered under different course numbers each subsequent year.
