\section{Preface}

The goal of this Fortran 90 tutorial is to give a quick introduction to
the key differences between Fortran 77 and Fortran 90. It is
\textit{not} a complete reference! Many details have been omitted. This
tutorial is based on the book \textit{"FORTRAN 77 for Engineers and
Scientists with an Introduction to Fortran 90"} by L. Nyhoff and S.
Leestma published by Prentice Hall.

This tutorial was designed by Sarah T. Whitlock to be used in the course
\textit{SCCM-001-F: Introduction to Fortran} taught at Stanford
University, Winter quarter 1997. It has been modified by Paul H.
Hargrove for use in the Fortran class taught Winter quarter 1998, under
the course number \textit{ME-390}. Permission to use this tutorial for
educational and other non-commercial purposes is granted provided all
author and copyright information is retained.
